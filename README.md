# Algos-in-giraph
This repository contains the famous algorithmic code of graphs that are implemented in Apache Giraph.
Algorithms implemented

1. Single Source Shortest Path (It comes with the default examples in Giraph)
2. PageRank Algorithm
3. Stochastic Gradient Descend (Used Agrregrator Class)
4. Label Propagation Algorithm
5. InDegree and OutDegree
6. MaxComputation

###Following are the screenshots describing the concepts of the above algorithms
**Note** InDegree OutDegree and MaxComputation is not explained here. It can be easily understood when learning the concepts of graphs or you can Google it.
